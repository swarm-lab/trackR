Installing [`trackR`](https://github.com/swarm-lab/trackR) should go 
smoothly on all major operating systems (Mac, Windows, "Ubuntu-like" Linux). 
There are a few steps to follow before installing the package itself in order to
install all the necessary dependencies. 

All installation steps are described below.

## 1 - Before installing 

### 1.1 - Windows

Before installing `trackR`, you will need to install the latest versions of
[`CMake`](https://cmake.org/) and [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). 

Download `CMake` for Windows at [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).

Download the latest "frozen" version of `Rtools` at 
[https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

In both cases, make sure to tell the installer to add `CMake` and `Rtools` to 
your "PATH".

### 1.2 - Mac

Before installing `trackR`, you will need to install the latest version of
[`CMake`](https://cmake.org/).

Download `CMake` for Mac at [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).
You can also use [`Homebrew`](http://brew.sh/) or [`MacPorts`](https://www.macports.org/)
if you prefer (I prefer!).

**Homebrew:**

```bash
brew install cmake
```

**MacPorts:**

```bash
sudo port install cmake
```

### 1.3 - Linux

Before installing `trackR`, you will need to install the latest version of
[`CMake`](https://cmake.org/).

Download `CMake` for Linux at [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).
However it is recommended that you install it using your distribution's package
management system.

**Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

[TODO: add more Linux install commands]

### 1.4 - Mac, Linux and Windows

Before installing `trackR`, you will need to install the `devtools` package 
in `R`. 

```r
install.package("devtools")
```

## 2 - Installing `trackR`

```r
devtools::install_github("swarm-lab/trackR")
```

This step may take some time if it is the first time that you are installing the 
`ROpenCVLite` dependency on your system. Go make yourself a cup of coffee or two.
